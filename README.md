Iâ€™d like to share my Portfolio Project, which I developed under the mentorship and guidance of Murat YÃ¼cedaÄŸ at MY YAZILIM EÄžÄ°TÄ°M AKADEMÄ° DANIÅžMANLIK.

In this project, we moved away from the traditional, static CV layout and built a dynamic, modern Portfolio & CV website. The result is a fully manageable, professional, and visually appealing platform that stands out from the typical resume format.

ðŸ’» Technologies & Features Used:

ASP.NET MVC Framework for a solid backend architecture

DB First Approach for efficient database integration

Entity Framework as the ORM tool

Implementation of PartialView, Paging, and dynamic data retrieval via DropDownList

Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a responsive and modern UI design

This project provided me with a comprehensive Full Stack development experience, allowing me to strengthen my skills in both backend and frontend development.
